Scroll reveals via IntersectionObserver or AOS; 60fps CSS transforms only

Parallax in hero (background translateY on scroll)

Animated counters; cursor-follow glow optional

Responsiveness & Layout:

Breakpoints: 320–767, 768–1023, 1024–1439, 1440+

Fluid, content-driven breakpoints; CSS Grid/Flex; clamp() typography; 44x44px tap targets

Avoid CLS: reserve image space with aspect-ratio; preload above-the-fold assets

Prefer SVG for logos/icons; WebP/AVIF for bitmaps

Performance Targets:

Lazy-load below-the-fold images/sections

Code split (for React): dynamic import for heavy sections; prefetch on hover

Tree-shake and minify; Brotli/Gzip compression assumption

Use srcset/sizes and width/height; defer non-critical JS; no layout thrash

Aim LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP good threshold​

Accessibility:

Semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, article, footer)

Proper landmark roles, aria-labels for interactive elements

Focus states visible; skip-to-content link; reduced motion respect (prefers-reduced-motion)

Color contrast WCAG AA; keyboard operability

SEO Essentials:

Title: “Fusion Web Solution | Full-Stack Growth Agency”

Meta description from positioning; relevant keywords (Web Development Agency US/UK, Full-Stack Digital Solutions, App Development India)

Open Graph + Twitter cards

JSON-LD Organization + WebSite + BreadcrumbList

H1–H3 hierarchy; internal anchors; alt text; blog content with headings and semantic structure

robots.txt and sitemap.xml stubs​

Conversion Optimization:

CTAs repeated: Hero, Services, Pricing, Portfolio, Contact

Social proof: badges, stats, logos; “Based in India, Serving Global Clients”

Lead capture modal (exit-intent or 30% scroll): “Free Consultation”

Sticky CTA on mobile

Technical Requirements per Stack:

A) React + Tailwind CSS

Use React hooks, IntersectionObserver, and requestAnimationFrame for scroll reveals

Tailwind core utilities only; no custom config; compose with className

Optimize with React.lazy/Suspense for sections; dynamic imports for portfolio, testimonials

Active nav via scroll spy; smooth scroll; aria-current on active link

Include .env examples for form endpoints (Formspree/Netlify Forms)

Build scripts ready (Vite or CRA alternative); production asset hints

B) HTML + CSS + vanilla JS (+ optional Bootstrap 5)

Semantic HTML5; pure CSS animations; IntersectionObserver for reveals

If Bootstrap: only import required components; use utility classes; purge unused

Write clean, modular CSS (BEM-ish) and minimize; no blocking CSS beyond critical above-the-fold

script.js: debounced scroll handlers, minimal DOM thrash

C) Single-Page Parallax

Tailwind or vanilla; prefers-reduced-motion handling

Implementation notes and rationale:

Mobile-first, flexible grids, fluid media, sensible breakpoints, and readable typography remain the spine of world-class responsiveness in 2024–2025.​

SPA performance and single-page patterns require careful JS budget, code-splitting, lazy-loading, and CLS avoidance to hit Core Web Vitals targets.​

Portfolio UX and agency trust are driven by curated case studies, layered visuals, micro-interactions, and modern motion—kept tasteful and performant.​

How to use this:

Paste the “Blaster Prompt” into your AI builder with your preferred stack.

If needed, ask it to output the full multi-file code bundle in one response with file headers.

Deploy to GitHub Pages/Vercel/Netlify, then run PageSpeed Insights and iterate image sizes and preloads.
